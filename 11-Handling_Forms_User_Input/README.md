## When To Validate? 

### When form is submitted
- Allows the user to enter a valid value before warning him / her
- Avoid unnecessary warnings but maybe present feedback "too late"

### When a input is losing focus
- Allows the user to enter a valid value before warning him / her
- Very useful for untouched forms 

<br>

### On every keystroke 
- Warns user before he / she had a chance of entering valid values
- If applied only on invalid inputs, has the potential of providing more direct feedback
